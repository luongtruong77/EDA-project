# EDA Project Proposal
- CEO of Greenwood LLC reaches out and proposes the opportunity to work with them and help them finding the best location for their expansion; specifically open their restaurant in New York city.
- The purpose of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to levarge the turnstile datasets from Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York) to determine the best location with the most potential volume of customers.
- We will use `Python`'s packages such as `pandas` annd `seaborn` to manipulate data, visualize data, and extract meaningful information from it.
- The target of this project is to determine the best (possibly) 3 locations which have the most volume of people circulating in the city.
- We will have to take into account the volume of people will differ between weekdays and weekends.
