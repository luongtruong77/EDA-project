- I utilized `pandas, matplotlib and seaborn` to extract information of the `MTA dataset` to get the top 5 stations with the most traffic in New York City between `8AM-10PM` from the last 17 weeks until now.
- The 34 ST-PENN Station is the station which has the most traffic where in the last 17 weeks, it peaks 5 million ENTRIES; followed by 86 St station with a little over 3.5 million and 23 St station with over 3.4 million.
- It's being showed from the graph that we have more traffic on weekdays than weekends; and it's understandable since people don't work on weekends.
- Based on our bussiness' purpose, I will recommend consider opening the new Vietnamese restaurant around the Korean town neighborhood - Manhattan for several reasons:
- - This neighborhood is surrounded by the top 4 stations with the most traffic (34 St - Penn, 23 St , 34 St - Herald Square, and Grand Central - 42 St)
- - There are little to none [Vietnamese restaurant](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=vietnamese&find_loc=Koreatown%2C+Manhattan%2C+NY+10001) around this neighborhood (because mostly Korean BBQ and restaurants) and people need to try something different.
- - The volume of Asian people is high in this neighborhood (residents and visitors), almost [half the population] (https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/berger2010/a-taste-of-the-world/the-history-of-koreatown/demographics-and-statistics/)
